#Redux

Redux is the data contained in an application, while React is the view contained in the application.  
Redux is a state container -> a collection of all the data that describes the app. Not only hard data, but also meta level properties (selected elements). React represents the views, which translates the apps data in something that can be displayed on the screen and the user can interact with.  

All the application's data is centralized in a single object (the state).  
Application-level state, big object that contains all the data of the application.
